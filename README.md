# Magento 2 Infinite Scroll
User experience plays a vital role in eCommerce stores that can convert the users into customers. Therefore, maintaining a good user experience is important for optimum conversion rates.


Magento 2 uses the traditional pagination method to display the products on your store which can be tedious for the users that are browsing products on your online store. In case you have plenty of products listed on the store, the users have to click the next button frequently to load the next page of products while browsing.
